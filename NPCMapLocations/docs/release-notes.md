# Release notes
## Upcoming release
* Overhauled mod settings:
  * Replaced the custom config UI with [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098).

  * Added support for controller/mouse button bindings.
  * Added support for [multi-key-bindings](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Key_Bindings#Multi-key_bindings).

    * whether to show the bookseller;
    * whether to show players' children;
    * whether to show farm buildings;
    * map marker sizes;
    * minimap opacity;
    * and caching for performance.

* Fixed various errors related to unexpected game or mod state.
* Internal changes to simplify maintenance.

**[Breaking changes]**
- You should now use [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) to edit the mod options, instead of pressing `Tab` from the map page.

## 2.5.1
Released 19 September 2019.

## 2.5.0
Released 19 September 2019.

This update focuses on making NPC Map Locations as future-proof and extensible as possible with
compatibility with other mods.

* All indoor locations are now located automatically (even custom locations), as long as there's tracking for its outdoor location and there's a valid warp into it. As a result, you may notice that characters are not perfectly centered within indoor locations on the map as they were before when they were located manually. This is still a much better solution in the long run.
* The default key binding for dragging the minimap is now `CTRL` instead of `ALT` to reduce keybind conflicts.

* Compatibility patches are now separate. You can download them from Optional Files on the mod page and unpack them into the mod's `maps` folder. Each folder in `maps` now has all the files needed for compatibility with that mod (including special config for Stardew Valley Expanded). For mod authors, see [mod author documentation](author-guide.md).

* Added option to show hidden NPCs instead of completely hiding them.

## 1.4
Released 13 October 2016.

* **New feature:**
  * Added feature to mark NPC with active daily quests (from the Bulletin Board) or on their birthdays.

    NPCs with active quests will have a `!` icon and NPCs with birthdays will have a Gift Box icon on the top-right corner of their map markers. Quest marks will disappear after the quest completes/expires and birthday marks will disappear when the NPC is gifted or the birthday ends.

    Marked NPCs will also always be at the top if they're in the same location as other NPCs.
* **Menu changes:**
  * Added new options (the new feature, an option to show the traveling merchant, and option to show any custom NPCs).
  * Added include/exclude NPC options for Sandy, Marlon, and Wizard (once unlocked).  
    _These options are mainly for any mods that add schedules to these NPCs (ex. marriage mod). Wizard is shown by default since he is a quest giver._
* **Minor changes/fixes:**
  * The name tooltip now stacks names in new lines instead of being one long string when there are a lot of NPCs in a location.
  * Tweaked the map.
  * Fixed issues in mod menu where clicks weren't being recieved properly for checkboxes/slider.
* **Custom NPC compatibility:**
  * Custom NPCs _with their own schedule files_ will now show up on the map and on the mod menu. Note that installing custom NPCs requires modification of save files, so they will only show up for save files that have been modified to include the custom NPCs. Even if the mod supports up to 5 custom NPCs, you can probably only reliably use one at a time due to the fact that they modify the same files, unless you can merge them correctly.

    Once the mod detects that a custom NPC has been properly installed, the custom NPC will automatically be included in the `config.json` file under `customNPCs: { }`. For example, for Florence it will look like:

    ```js
    "customNPCs": {
        "Florence": {
            "id": 1,
            "crop": 0,
            "Bouhm_135372711": 1
        }
    }
    ```

   You can change how the custom NPC's head is cropped to show up on the map by changing the number for `"crop": 0`. Setting it to `3` will move the NPC sprite 3 pixels, setting it to `-3` will move the NPC sprite down by 3 pixels. It is set to `0` by default and will probably only need to be tweaked for custom NPC sprites that are particularly tall or short.
